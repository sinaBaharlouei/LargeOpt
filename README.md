Slides, Codes and Resources for Large-scale Optimization and Its Applications in Machine Learning

## Resources for Large-scale Optimization
* [Large-scale Optimization for Machine Learning Lectures by Professor Razaviyayn](https://sites.usc.edu/razaviyayn/teaching-ise-633/)
* Learning iteration complexity, optimal first-order methods for convex problems (smooth and non-smooth), and semi-definite programming:
[Introductory Lectures On Convex Programming](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.693.855&rep=rep1&type=pdf)
* For understanding different types of errors (Bayes error, Estimation Error, Approximation Error, and Optimization Error) check out this awesome paper from ICML 2008:
[Understanding Different Types of error in Machine Learning](http://icml2008.cs.helsinki.fi/papers/266.pdf)  
* Robust PCA (The original paper by Candes):
[Robust PCA](https://arxiv.org/abs/0912.3599)
* An awesome reference for the application of sparsity in statistical learning:
[Statistical Learning with Sparsity (The Lasso and Generalizations)](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/StatLearnSparsity_files/SLS.pdf)
* Netflix Prize Problem:
[The Netflix Prize and Singular Value Decomposition](https://pantelis.github.io/cs301/docs/common/lectures/recommenders/netflix)
* Optimization Algorithms for Big Data (Block Coordinate Descent, ADMM):
[A Unified Algorithmic Framework for Block-Structured Optimization Involving Big Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.02746.pdf)

## Resources for Probability, Statistics, and Statistical Learning Theory

* Theory of Probability (Rigorous Mathematical Introduction to Probability): [Lecture Notes by Professor Heilman]()
* Theory of Point Estimation: See chapters 1-5 [Book](https://www.dcpehvpm.org/E-Content/Stat/E%20L%20Lehaman.pdf)
* Hypothesis Testing: A detailed book for deep understanding of hypothesis testing [Book](https://sites.stat.washington.edu/jaw/COURSES/580s/582/HO/Lehmann_and_Romano-TestingStatisticalHypotheses.pdf)
